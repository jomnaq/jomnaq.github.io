# Resource X (2025)

      Resource X was a game I made with a team of 3 others for UCLA's first ever Fiat Ludum game jam, partnered with UCLA Recreation and E-Sports. The theme was "begin anew" and we really wanted to shoot our shot at making a horror-esque game, so we went with a shader heavy, keyboard terminal game set in an apocalypse.

We wanted a something that required a heavy amount of multi-tasking in order to induce a feeling of anxiety, but also wanted to have challenging "mini-games" in the form of puzzles. And, of course, to stand out amongst other jammers, we wanted to have a very uniquely unsettling visual style.

Unlike many of my earlier jams, this time around my teammates and I all dabbled in every aspect. I picked up Blender for the first time to model the tunnel and the ship and created the rest of the map with the Unity terrain painting. I programmed the movement of the resource, formatted and animated the text of some of the computer screens, and fiddled with adding shaders and VFX like grain and light flickering. I even dabbled with mixing and creating sound effects like the vent clicks and wind noise. Overall, I was able to try and learn several new aspects of game development, which I really enjoyed.

Designing the map and the puzzles was one of the most exciting parts about the jam. Having to cleverly think of ways to simultaneously guide the player while also challenge them was difficult, and we were forced to iterate over and over on our puzzle ideas and playtest them with random friends who hung around our workspace.

Something we definitely struggled with due to the time crunch was being able to balance the difficulty and audio of the gameplay. From this experience, I definitely learned to never trust players to read anything longer than a sentence, and that many times, without direct guidance, players might not know what to do at all.

Overall, Resource X was one of the games I felt I learned the most about game development with, and is definitely one of my favorites!
