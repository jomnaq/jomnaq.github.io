# 'LOTLNECK (2024)

<div class="row align-items-center">

      I collaborated with two friends to create a simple instance runner with a moral-dilemma twist for our clubâ€™s annual Studio Jam, where the top games are featured on the club website. Our game placed 2nd overall.

The theme of the game jam was **"Break the Cycle"**,  so after some brainstorming and influences from the recent wave of related memes, our team created an endless runner with a silly twist: players must weigh axolotl deaths against gameplay debuffs, drawing on the classic trolley problem for inspiration.

I took the charge of the game's art direction and assets, as well as collaborated with the programmer to create buffs and debuffs for the player to pick from. Below is some of the artistic process to creating out game.
