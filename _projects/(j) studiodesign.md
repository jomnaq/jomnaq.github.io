# ACM Studio (2025)
<p>
    The first design project I had with ACM Studio was designing a sticker of the club's mascot that recently debuted, Sooper. Below was the progression of the design, from rough sketch and clean sketch in Procreate to the final design in Figma.

    I also helped with other marketing graphics for the club, including the following post of our club's schedule and beach social event.
