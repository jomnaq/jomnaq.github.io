# **about me**

Hi! I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave: <br>

I'm a rising senior student at UCLA majoring in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Computing and a minor in Data Science Engineering.

I’ve always been passionate about using design and technology to find innovative and user friendly solutions, and I'm fascinated by the brain—how it perceives, processes, and functions. 

My goal is to contribute to impactful research or technological innovation, whether in medicine, sustainability, or entertainment. I’m driven to ensure the work I do has purpose and leaves a lasting positive impact.

## some fun facts
- I grew up in Denver, CO and moved to Moraga, CA right before high school
- I did artistic swimming for 13 years---in fact, it's why I moved to CA
- I enjoy game development, and my current favorite game is FFXIV (progging TEA Ultimate now!)
- I love to do arts and crafts, including but not limited to making jewelry, scrapbooking, and sketching
